		<p>In addition, I am focusing my career in the following areas:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>JS libraries:</b>&nbsp;I want to achieve a high level of expertise in working with JS libraries such as: JQuery, AngularJS and D3.js.</li>
			<li><b>Web Mapping APIs:</b>&nbsp;I want to master the use of web mapping APIs to be able to create rich web mapping applications.</li>
			<li><b>Website templating:</b>&nbsp;Creating efficient, simple and elegant templates for websites is another one of my goals as a web developer.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I also have a great interest in <b>static site generators</b> which are growing in popularity. This website itself has been created using <b>Jekyll</b> and I have integrated <b>customized Twitter-Bootstrap plugins</b> into it.</p>
